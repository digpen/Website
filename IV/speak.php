    <h3>Hints</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Tell us something we can't learn from Wikipedia or reading the documentation.</li>
              <li>Tell us why we should take the time to  learn more about it.</li>
              <li>Share your experience of using it  on a real project, and all stuff you've learned that they <em>don't</em> tell you on the website.            </li>
              <li>We like discussion sessions that get the whole audience sharing practices and ideas.</li>
              <li>The day is about both practical learning and  taking time out to think about the bigger picture. It doesn't matter which your session is.</li>
              <li>We hope to have some break-out sessions, so don't be afraid to suggest an in-depth session on a specialist topic.</li>
              <li>We aren't officially offering 20 minute sessions, but if you desparately want to talk for more than 10 minutes yet don't think you can manage a full half-hour, let us know in the comments box at the end.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>The rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>No selling</strong>! <br />
              We love case studies, but if you just want to pitch a project, beg for a job, tell people how great you are to work for, or show off stuff you've done, you'll need to take one of our 3-Minute Pitch slots. These are free for students, non-profit, open-source and community projects. Everyone else  is asked to contribute &pound;10 to the #digpen coffers if they want to pitch to our captive audience.<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li><strong>5 minute talks get one slide</strong><br />
                This is to
              keep changeover time to a minimum. All other talks can have as many slides as they like.</li>
            </ul>
