    <h2>Speakers</h2>
    <h3>You?</h3>
            <p>We are looking for talks, discussions and workshops on any subject relating to web design and development.  If you have an idea for a session, just <a href="speak.php">send us a short session proposal</a>. We have slots suitable for all types of talk, from short 5 minute tasters to full 45 minute workshops.</p>

              Submission Deadline: ASAP, but no later than <strong>Fri 24 Feb</strong>.<br />
</p>
<h3>First-time speaker? #digpen wants you!</h3>
            <p> #digpen is all about mutual support and helping people develop their skills. We have slots specifically for people who haven't spoken at conferences before, but want to give it a try. Why not <a href="speak.php">suggest a short 5 or 10 minute talk</a>, on a subject you find interesting?</p>
            <h3>Showcase or Pitch?</h3>
            <p>If you  want to pitch a project, beg for a job, tell people how great you are to work for, or just show off stuff you've done, sign up for one of our 3-Minute Pitch slots. These are free for students, non-profit, open-source and community projects. Everyone else  is asked to contribute &pound;10 to the #digpen coffers if they want to pitch to our captive audience. </p>
            <p>Just use the <a href="speak.php">session proposal form</a> and pick &quot;Pitch / Showcase&quot;. We'll be in touch about the tenner&hellip;</p>
            <p>Don't want to pay? Think of a way to turn your pitch into a useful short talk or case study instead. </p>
